						Terrell Hull holds several industry certifications in project management,
						has extensive management experience, and has been held accountable
						for budget and profitability for numerous large-scale software projects, 
						ranging from a dozen to over 50 direct reports. His practical management 
						experience is complimented with a solid formal educational background in 
						business management, project management, managerial accounting, and advanced 
						psychology coursework in motivational leadership.
					</p>
					<p class="text">
						A "Theory Y" manager, he believes that the key to managing well is leadership. 
						Leadership requires a genuine concern for each member of the team, and a leader 
						is careful to listen to team members. Team members must feel as though they are 
						part of the organization. Participative management and empowerment are very 
						effective means of eliciting the Hawthorne Effect, which he has found to be a 
						powerful tool in leading people to achieve above and beyond expectations. 
						Terrell has a special gift for motivating teams, and is a dedicated mentor and 
						example to his team. He is very effective at inspiring team members, so that 
						they look forward to coming to work. He gives purpose and meaning to the work, 
						and impresses upon them the value of their contributions to the overall team 
						achievement. He has found that when team members enjoy what they are doing, and 
						feel that they have the training and tools to do their jobs effectively, they 
						tend to perform best.
					</p>
					<p class="text">
						He subscribes to the "Two-factor Theory of Motivation," which holds that 
						hygiene and motivation are inextricably linked to employee productivity and job 
						satisfaction. Hygiene encompasses the following factors:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Working conditions
						</li>
						<li>
							Tools
						</li>
						<li>
							Socio-political environment
						</li>
						<li>
							Corporate culture
						</li>
						<li>
							Interpersonal relationships
						</li>
						<li>
							Compensation
						</li>
						<li>
							Job security
						</li>
						<li>
							Company policies and administration
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="text">
						Motivation is comprised of the potential opportunities for:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Achievement
						</li>
						<li>
							Increased responsibility
						</li>
						<li>
							Recognition
						</li>
						<li>
							Growth
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="text">
						Using this approach, Terrell has been particularly effective at bringing out 
						the best in teams and individuals, and helping them achieve more than they 
						thought possible. Terrell has received numerous commendations for his natural 
						abilities as a leader, and works constantly to increase his knowledge and 
						experience in management. He enjoys management, because it provides him with an 
						opportunity to learn more about himself, and how to be a better leader and 
						mentor to his teams. Here are some of the things his customers have said about him:
					</p>
					<blockquote>
						"I have worked with Terrell Hull for many years and I can attest to his excellent
						capabilities in different assignments, from architecture to project and program
						manager.  He has an unusual capability to work very well at a high level but also has
						a keen understanding of the low level details.  He is absolutely committed to the
						success of his assignments and does not spare any effort to make the deadlines
						and achieve results with the highest standards.  He consistently makes time and budget
						he was entrusted with.  I would not hestitate to endorse Terrell in any job that will
						require leadership, creative thinking, a high level business understanding and
						excellent analytical capabilities."
						"<i>&mdash;Dr. Olga Dold&aacute;n White, Senior Director, Global Enterprise Architecture,
						DHL Global Head Office, Bonn, Germany, February 20, 2010</i>
					</blockquote>
					<blockquote>
						"Terrell was the US Business IT contact for my projects.  He came into the group
						during a time of many layoffs and strategy changes.  Projects were being changed
						and some cancelled.  Not knowing quite what to expect, he took the bull by the horns,
						came up to speed on what needed to be done and got it done.  It wasn't that easy, however.
						Terrell had to contend with directions that were also changing with his own management
						structure on how the project should be handled for the US.  He... formed the team, and worked diligently
						with the team to make sure they made the scheduled deadline required by global.  The
						global project... [brought] a substantial reduction in IT costs...&mdash; a savings of
						$2.5 million (&euro;1.8 M)..., exceeding the... estimate of $1.7 million (&euro;1.2 M).
						The [project] was completed on time, on budget and without failures.  Good work!"
						"<i>&mdash;Fay Niederhaus, Global Ops Business IT Domain Manager, DHL, October 18, 2009</i>
					</blockquote>
					<blockquote>
						"Terrell... has an innate ability to synthesize very complex technical information into
						a format that a customer can understand and act on.  He... [delivered projects] in a time of
						immense change to the corporate structure..., in addition the business customer's requirements
						changed daily.  His ability to manage the change, keeping the project on target and under
						budget was no less than amazing.  I highly recommend Terrell and would work with him or
						for him at any opportunity.
						"<i>&mdash;Mark Masterson, Global Head of Shared Systems and Management Reporting, VP of IT,
						DHL, February 3, 2010</i>
					</blockquote>
					<blockquote>
						"Terrell is a natural leader. He has been an inspiration, and really 
						kept our teams going even when our mission seemed impossible. Because of 
						Terrell's leadership, he earned a reputation for our team of on-time delivery 
						of first-quality components, and instilled a confidence in our client... to the 
						point where in the following development cycles all of the mission-critical 
						parts of the application fell to us, and the size of our team was tripled."<i>&mdash;Steve
						Knipe, Team Lead, Application and Technical Architecture Team, January 18, 1999</i>
					</blockquote>
					<blockquote>
						"I... want to thank Terrell Hull for teaching me what 
						leadership is, and showing us his passion for the work. [He has] been a source 
						of constant inspiration for the team. With this kind of teamwork, how can we 
						possibly not succeed! "<i>&mdash;Micheal Ng, Principal Architect, July 19, 1998</i>
					</blockquote>
					<blockquote>
						"I met Terrell in 1995... on the Iridium project at Motorola.... I was 
						immediately impressed with [his] grasp of the important issues in his work.... 
						His never ending quest for better ways to do more continues to impress me.... I 
						have noticed that many people gravitate to [him] for his knowledge and 
						inspiration.... Terrell is a rare blend of intellect and action. "<i>&mdash;Dr. Malcolm
						Currie, Control Systems Engineer, February 15, 2007</i>
